In the secondary trial, the time frame for evaluating change in Masood Score is from baseline to 6 months. To compare the trials, we need to convert the time units to a common measure. Since 8 weeks is approximately equal to 2 months, the change in Masood Score from baseline to 6 months in the secondary trial can be considered equivalent to the assessment of pCR at 8 weeks (2 months) in the primary trial in terms of the time frame for evaluating treatment response. The comparison does not contradict the information in the CTRs and finds substantiation through the conversion of time units, allowing for a valid semantic entailment.</s>",

Disease progression was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study, including baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeters (mm). For non-target lesions, disease progression was defined as unequivocal progression of existing lesions. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered progression.\n  Time frame: From randomization until the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs earlier (up to the 15 Oct 2017 data cutoff, approximately 2.5 years)\nResults 1: \n  Arm/Group Title: Placebo+Fulvestrant\n  Arm/Group Description: Participants received placebo taken orally QD beginning at Cycle 1, Day 1, and fulvestrant 500 mg administered by IM injection at Cycle 1, Days 1 and 15, and then on Day 1 of each subsequent 28-day cycle until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study termination by the Sponsor.\n  Overall Number of Participants Analyzed: 176\n  Median (95% Confidence Interval)\n  Unit of Measure: months  5.39        (3.68 to 7.29)\nResults 2: \n  Arm/Group Title: Taselisib+Fulvestrant\n  Arm/Group Description: Participants received taselisib 4 mg taken orally QD beginning at Cycle 1, Day 1 and fulvestrant 500 mg by IM injection at Cycle 1, Days 1 and 15, and then on Day 1 of each subsequent 28-day cycle until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study termination by the Sponsor.\n  Overall Number of Participants Analyzed: 340\n  Median (95% Confidence Interval)\n  Unit of Measure: months  7.43        (7.26 to 9.07)\n\nReflect upon the ensuing statement crafted by an expert in clinical trials.\n\nthe primary trial and the secondary trial have non-comparable outcome measurements for their results\n\nExplain why the information contained in this statement can be entailed by the information present in the CTRs.

Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions.\n  Time frame: Evaluated every 6 weeks from the time of their first treatment, per RECIST 1.1. Duration of therapy will depend on individual response, evidence of disease progression and tolerance, up to 1 year\nResults 1: \n  Arm/Group Title: Cisplatin + AZD1775\n  Arm/Group Description: Treatment will consist of one cycle of cisplatin monotherapy (cisplatin 75 mg/m2 IV x1) followed by combination therapy of AZD1775 plus cisplatin starting 21 days(1 cycle) later.\n  AZD1775 will be administered 200 mg as twice daily oral dosing predetermined dosing schedule, in combination with Cisplatin predetermined dosage every 21 days.\n  At least 10 patients will undergo a research biopsy within 5-48 hours after beginning cisplatin (Cycle 1 Day 1) and then again within 5-8 hours after the last dose of AZD1775 in cycle 2 (Cycle 2 Day 3).\n  Overall Number of Participants Analyzed: 34\n  Measure Type: Number\n  Unit of Measure: percentage of participants  26        (13 to 44)\n\nSecondary Trial:\nOutcome Measurement: \n  Proportion of Sentinel Lymph Nodes (SLNs) Flagged by the Two Methods\n  Let A be the number of Tc-positive and ICG-positive sentinel nodes (SNs) detected, B be the number of Tc-positive and ICG-negative SNs detected, and C be the number of Tc-negative and ICG-positive SNs detected. The total number (N) of SNs detected is therefore N = (A + B + C); the proportion of SNs detected by the Tc method (PTc) is (A + B)/N; and the proportion of SNs detected by the ICG method (PICG) is (A + C)/N.

In the event of the appearance of a <6 mm lesions(s) without CNS lesions, or equivocal findings potentially suggesting leptomeningeal disease, these findings were followed with a subsequent scan within 6 weeks. If unequivocal progression was determined with the subsequent scan and/or CNS symptoms occurred, then CNS relapse crieria were met.\n  Time frame: From randomization until disease progression, death, or discontinuation from the study (average of 10 months).
