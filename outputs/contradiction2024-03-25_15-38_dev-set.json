In fact, the inclusion and exclusion conditions of the two trials are indeed different. The primary trial has specific criteria for breast cancer diagnosis, eligibility based on previous therapies and disease status, as well as requirements for tissue availability and imaging studies. In contrast, the secondary trial targets patients with ErbB2(HER2) overexpressing breast cancer and brain metastases, who have undergone prior WBR and/or SRS and trastuzumab therapy. Additionally, the secondary trial has specific requirements for kidney and liver function and the ability to swallow an oral medication. These differences in inclusion and exclusion conditions between the trials make the statement consistent with the CTR information.</s>",

In contrast, the secondary trial targets patients with ErbB2(HER2) overexpressing breast cancer and brain metastases, who have undergone prior WBR and/or SRS and trastuzumab therapy.

Here, the time to event was reported as the restricted mean survival time.

Prior treatment must be discontinued at least 2 weeks before treatment start.\n  Concomitant therapy with bisphosphonates is allowed.\n  Stable dose coumadin anticoagulation is allowed, providing that anticoagulation can be safely held to an International Normalized Ratio (INR) within normal range for the purpose of tumor biopsy. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH is the preferred method of anticoagulation.\n  Prothrombin time (PT)/International Normalized Ratio (INR) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) within institutional normal limits within two weeks before initial biopsy.\n  Measurable disease, as defined by RECIST guidelines or evaluable disease. Bone metastases must be evaluable.\n  Disease amenable to core biopsy. Patients with pulmonary metastases as their only site of disease may enroll on this trial and will not undergo biopsy.\n  For Phase I: patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpressing disease must have been previously treated with trastuzumab.

In patients with liver dysfunction due to hepatic metastases, AST and ALT are permitted to be </= 5 times the ULN.\n  At baseline: Ejection fraction (EF)  50%, no evidence of QT prolongation, no history of congenital long QT syndrome, and no use of drugs known to increase the risk of Torsades de Point - patients may be eligible for study if the drug can be changed to another agent with less risk (such as changing from citalopram to an alternate antidepressant).\n  Able to take oral medications and maintain hydration.\n  Ability to give written informed consent and willingness to comply with the requirements of the protocol\n  Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use an effective method of birth control during treatment and for six months after receiving their last dose of study drug\n  Specific inclusion criteria for Phase II\n Patients enrolling on the phase II portion of this trial must have ER, progesterone receptors (PR) and HER2 negative disease defined as less than 10% staining for ER and PR, and HER2 not amplified byFluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), 0-1% by Immunohistochemistry (IHC), or 2+ by IHC and no evidence of amplification by FISH.\nExclusion Criteria:\n  Treatment with another chemotherapy or hormonal therapy within the past 2 weeks.\n  Treatment with trastuzumab, bevacizumab or other targeted therapies within the past 2 weeks.\n  Concurrent treatment with radiotherapy.\n  Ongoing treatment with any other investigational therapy.\n  Prior treatment with eribulin\n  Severe, concurrent illness including congestive heart failure, significant cardiac disease and uncontrolled hypertension, that would likely prevent the patient from being able to comply with the study protocol.\n  Inadequate bone marrow, renal, or hepatic function as defined above, or an active coagulopathy that precludes tissue biopsy.\n  Pregnant or lactating women and women of child-bearing potential who are not using an effective method of birth control.

Comprehensive CTRs comprise four sections: (1) ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA delineating conditions for patient inclusion, (2) INTERVENTION particulars specifying type, dosage, frequency, and duration of treatments, (3) RESULTS summary encompassing participant statistics, outcome measures, units, and conclusions, and (4) ADVERSE EVENTS cataloging signs and symptoms observed.

Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PR or better overall response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions.\n  Time frame: Evaluated every 6 weeks from the time of their first treatment, per RECIST 1.1.
