However, both CTRs presented here describe individual trials with different treatment arms (IMQ+RT and CTX/IMQ/RT). Therefore, if the expert intended to refer to a single trial with these treatment combinations, then the statement is accurate. But, if the expert meant to refer to a comparative analysis of both trials investigating the effects of IMQ+RT and CTX/IMQ/RT collectively, then the statement needs modification to specify that the trials are being compared. In that case, the term \"primary trial\" may be misleading, and a clearer statement would be needed to avoid potential confusion or contradiction with the CTR information."

The statement implies a comparison of the two groups in terms of their percentage of participants with objective response (OR). The CTRs provide the OR data for each group but do not directly compare them. Additionally, the CIs overlap, which implies that the difference in OR percentages between the groups could be due to chance. Further analysis, such as statistical testing, would be necessary to determine if there is a significant difference in OR between the two cohorts.
